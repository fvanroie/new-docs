</div>

## Settings

### Short Idle ### {: .param }
When the display has not been touched for the Short Idle amount of seconds, an `idle = short` event will be sent out.

### Long Idle ### {: .param }
When the display has not been touched for Long + Short Idle amount of seconds, an `idle = long` event will be sent out.

The Long Idle period begins to count *after* the Short Idle period.

### Orientation ### {: .param }
Rotate the display by the set number of degrees and optionally mirror the display as well.

### Invert Colors ### {: .param }
Enable color inversion of the display. This can be enabled if the colors on the display are wrong *e.g. cyan objects is displayed in orange*.

### Show Pointer ### {: .param }
Enable this option to show a mouse pointer. This helps with checking if the touches are correctly detected.
The pointer is hidden automatically when the display is idle.

### Backlight Pin ### {: .param }
Sets the GPIO pin which is used for PWM dimming of the backlight.

### Invert Backlight ### {: .param }
By default openHASP will set the backlight pin `HIGH` to turn on the backlight.
For some devices, the backlight will turn on when the pin is `LOW` instead.
Enable Invert Backlight to swap the *on/off* behavior.

## Actions
### Calibrate

*Only available with XPT2046 resistive touchscreen controllers.*

Starts an on-screen calibration sequence.

### Run Anti Burn-in

Click this button to run the `antiburn` command, which will display *white noise* on the LCD for approximately 30 seconds.
This can help to reduce ghosting of a static image on some displays. It also trains the pixels to show different colors which can prolong the lifespan of the display.
